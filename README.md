# TRAINIACS

Trainiacs is an exciting new website aimed at bringing Trainspotters together. Usually a solitary pasttime, the regular meetings and trips to spotting sites, open days and galas allows spotters to make new friends, save money on travel and accommodation and share gen over a good pint!

The website is designed as a simple way for people to find out about the meetings and trips, see photos shared by other users and sign up for regular emails to update them on meetings and how to book on for events. It also links to social media, where users can share more information and interact.

#### Trainiacs - when Trainspotting goes social! 
Ever thought how good it would be to have someone else to share your cops with over a good beer? Got some good spotting locations you want to share with others? Fancy some company at the end of the platform? Look no further, Trainiacs is for you!

Monthly meetings at a pub recommended by the Good Beer Guide, a great opportunity to share all your trainspotting stories and help each other with identifying locos and stock. Separate meetings for modern traction, heritage diesel and heritage steam, to allow for a focus on a specific interest and plan trips focussed on those specific themes.

Save money on travel and tickets using group discounts, learn about hidden gem locations, compare notes on missing all-timers and make friends who share your passion!
