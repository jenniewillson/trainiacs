# TRAINIACS

Trainiacs is an exciting new website aimed at bringing Trainspotters together. Usually a solitary pasttime, the regular meetings and trips to spotting sites, open days and galas allows spotters to make new friends, save money on travel and accommodation and share gen over a good pint!

The website is designed as a simple way for people to find out about the meetings and trips, see photos shared by other users and sign up for regular emails to update them on meetings and how to book on for events. It also links to social media, where users can share more information and interact.

### Trainiacs - when Trainspotting goes social! 
Ever thought how good it would be to have someone else to share your cops with over a good beer? Got some good spotting locations you want to share with others? Fancy some company at the end of the platform? Look no further, Trainiacs is for you!

Monthly meetings at a pub recommended by the Good Beer Guide, a great opportunity to share all your trainspotting stories and help each other with identifying locos and stock. Separate meetings for modern traction, heritage diesel and heritage steam, to allow for a focus on a specific interest and plan trips focussed on those specific themes.

Save money on travel and tickets using group discounts, learn about hidden gem locations, compare notes on missing all-timers and make friends who share your passion!

## Design Choices

This website is aimed at trainspotters. Trainspotters are usually extremely knowledgeable about their subject and will likely be quite critical of a website that clearly doesn't know the terminology etc. It will be important to demonstrate this knowledge and understanding through the design of the website, tapping in to the subconscious of the user by using recognisable colours and design styles.

### Colours

I am using [GWR liveries webpages](http://www.gwr.org.uk/liveries.html) to ensure I am using the correct colour scheme.

#### Colour  palette
This colour palette incorporates the 'chocolate' and 'cream' of the traditional pullman coaches and the deep red and green of the GWR locomotives, along with the gold of the name and number plates. This will be familiar to users and attract them to an authentic looking website immediately they see the nostalgic colouring.

![Trainiacs colour palette](https://github.com/jenniewillson/trainiacs/assets/127458925/26cc75cf-c113-460e-ad20-404c7c97a75f)

### Typography

For the same reason, I looked for fonts that represented the old GWR train nameplates and station signs. The nameplate font would work well for larger titles etc, with the simpler, easy to read station signage for the main site font.

#### Titles
The GWR font does not exist as an available online font, so I have chosen Source Serif Pro, Black 900, which is reasonably close. This may need the spacing increasing a little between letters.

#### General text

Having looked at the font for the same era station signs, it was all uppercase, which would not make the website very easy to read for larger pieces of text. I decided to take inspiration instead from the more modern station signs of today, which generally have quite a simple sans-serif type font that is not too narrow and not too closely spaced. For that reason I have chosen Open Sans.

# Features

## Version control

At the beginning of the project I had two problems - firstly that I had misunderstood the teaching videos and thought it was telling me to commit code after each session of work. Secondly I had a problem with CodeAnywhere which was preventing me from committing anything as it kept telling me it didn't know my identity and the suggested fixes were not working. I had to carry on working due to time constraints.

Once this was resolved and I understood the requirement I have been committing code much more regularly and after each major change and recognise that this is the correct way to work and manage the code and project. I am unable to go back and change this, but have done my best to improve this going forward.

## Implemented features
