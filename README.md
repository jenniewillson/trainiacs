# TRAINIACS

Trainiacs is an exciting new website aimed at bringing Trainspotters together. Usually a solitary pasttime, the regular meetings and trips to spotting sites, open days and galas allows spotters to make new friends, save money on travel and accommodation and share gen over a good pint!

The website is designed as a simple way for people to find out about the meetings and trips, see photos shared by other users and sign up for regular emails to update them on meetings and how to book on for events. It also links to social media, where users can share more information and interact.

### Trainiacs - when Trainspotting goes social! 
Ever thought how good it would be to have someone else to share your cops with over a good beer? Got some good spotting locations you want to share with others? Fancy some company at the end of the platform? Look no further, Trainiacs is for you!

Monthly meetings at a pub recommended by the Good Beer Guide, a great opportunity to share all your trainspotting stories and help each other with identifying locos and stock. Separate meetings for modern traction, heritage diesel and heritage steam, to allow for a focus on a specific interest and plan trips focussed on those specific themes.

Save money on travel and tickets using group discounts, learn about hidden gem locations, compare notes on missing all-timers and make friends who share your passion!

## Design Choices

This website is aimed at trainspotters. Trainspotters are usually extremely knowledgeable about their subject and will likely be quite critical of a website that clearly doesn't know the terminology etc. It will be important to demonstrate this knowledge and understanding through the design of the website, tapping in to the subconscious of the user by using recognisable colours and design styles.

### Colours

I am using [GWR liveries webpages](http://www.gwr.org.uk/liveries.html) to ensure I am using the correct colour scheme.

#### Colour  palette
This colour palette incorporates the 'chocolate' and 'cream' of the traditional pullman coaches and the deep red and green of the GWR locomotives, along with the gold of the name and number plates. This will be familiar to users and attract them to an authentic looking website immediately they see the nostalgic colouring.

![Trainiacs colour palette](https://github.com/jenniewillson/trainiacs/assets/127458925/26cc75cf-c113-460e-ad20-404c7c97a75f)

### Typography

For the same reason, I looked for fonts that represented the old GWR train nameplates and station signs. The nameplate font would work well for larger titles etc, with the simpler, easy to read station signage for the main site font.

#### Titles
The GWR font does not exist as an available online font, so I have chosen Source Serif Pro, Black 900, which is reasonably close. This may need the spacing increasing a little between letters.

#### General text

Having looked at the font for the same era station signs, it was all uppercase, which would not make the website very easy to read for larger pieces of text. I decided to take inspiration instead from the more modern station signs of today, which generally have quite a simple sans-serif type font that is not too narrow and not too closely spaced. For that reason I have chosen Open Sans.

# Features

## Version control

At the beginning of the project I had two problems - firstly that I had misunderstood the teaching videos and thought it was telling me to commit code after each session of work. Secondly I had a problem with CodeAnywhere which was preventing me from committing anything as it kept telling me it didn't know my identity and the suggested fixes were not working. I had to carry on working due to time constraints.

Once this was resolved and I understood the requirement I have been committing code much more regularly and after each major change and recognise that this is the correct way to work and manage the code and project. I am unable to go back and change this, but have done my best to improve this going forward.

## Implemented features

### Header

- Priority - brand identity and easy navigation
- Used logo that fitted with the theme
- Logo links back to home page, as this is intuitive as a lot of websites work this way
- Menu is responsive - Hamburger for smaller screens and navbar for wider
- Did consider navbar remaining at top when scrolling but decided this wasn't an essential as only the gallery page is likely to scroll the menu out of sight.

### Footer

- Contact us link - intuitive to users to find this in the footer, despite it being available elsewhere
- Telephone contact and email available here as likely to be preferred by target audience
- Social media links avaialble and opening in a new tab

### Home page

- Pictures to capture the user's interest
- Immediate obvious links to theme pages from large pictures as well as menu
- Simple and styled to theme

### Theme pages

- three clear sections, as below
- clear separation with background
- easy links where needed, covering whole section rather than requiring pixel hunting
- links in addition to menu

#### Meetings

- clearly showing the next few meetings
- fun 'timeline' icon of train track fits with theme
- links to meeting location where relevant, also opening in separate tabs

#### Contact link

- Gives a bit more information about signing up

#### Gallery taster

- Gives a taster of the gallery images, appropriate to the page theme 

### Gallery

- Shows a range of photos of interest to users
- Responsive and flexible - so different images can be swapped in and out over time
- Photo description avaialble on hover

### Contact form

- Allows users to sign up for an email list

successfully

### Custom 404 page

- Appears more professional as it is styled to the theme

## Future features

- to have a longer term calendar of events available, to be able to filter them on topic and to be able to have them in a database that dynamically updates
- to be able to sign up for events with a number limit and ability to pay online
- consider adding a Q&A style page that users can post in and give answers and get email updates
- Future development to make at least one checkbox mandatory and to have a member page where you can update your mailing preferences
- Mailing form would be connected to an endpoint and a database of details and preferences
- Add GDPR statement

### Ability for users to submit photos

### Mandatory check boxes on form
